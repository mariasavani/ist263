            <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        
        <p>Hello, my name is Maria Savani. My major is policy studies and my minor is information management and technology. I enjoy studying how policy influences society, government, business, and environment. I have been given the honor of exploring many different kinds of policy in my day to day life which introduced me to many educational opportunities. Outside of school I enjoy <strong>cooking</strong>, spinning, and spending time with my family in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
