        Have you ever wondered what the food you eat every day can tell you about where you come from? Have you ever wondered why people from different parts of the world eat different types of food? Do you ever ask yourself why certain foods or culinary traditions are so important to your culture? There is more connection between food and culture than you may think. <br>
<br> 
Since the beginning of time, food has defined locations worldwide. You can learn a lot about a culture by simply indulging in their culinary traditions. People from different backgrounds eat unique foods. The countries and regions where our ancestors originated have a significant influence on preparing food. The ingredients, spices, and combinations tell a story that lasts eternities.  <br>
<br>
We should embrace our heritage through our culture’s food, but we should also become more informed about other cultures by trying their foods. It’s important to remember that each dish has a special place in the culture to which it belongs and is unique to those who prepare it. Food is a portal into a culture, and it should be treated as such. This is your sign to go out and travel the world. Traveling is one of the best ways to enhance personal growth. It enables you to do things differently from your daily routine activities. When you travel, you step out from your comfort zone to a different environment, making you more responsible and giving a sense of independence.

          Hello, my name is Maria Savani. My major is policy studies and my minor is information management and technology. I enjoy studying how policy influences society, government, business, and environment. I have been given the honor of exploring many different kinds of policy in my day to day life which introduced me to many educational opportunities. Outside of school I enjoy <strong>cooking</strong>, exploring the world, and spending time with my family in Cleveland, Ohio. Ever since I was a kid I have had a passion for food and cooking. Nothing excites me more than the idea of traveling around the world and endulging myelf in coutries culinary traditions. I have created this cite to inspire people like me to travel around the word and taste foods that define each coutry.
