    Have you ever wondered what the food you eat everyday can tell you about where you come from? Have you ever wondered why people
from different parts of the world eat different types of food? Do you ever ask yourself why certain foods or culinary traditions are so important to
your culture? There is more of a connection between food and culture than you may think. <br>
<br> 
    Since the beginning of time food has defined locations from around the world. You can learn a lot about a culture by simply indulging in
there culinary traditions. People from different cultural backgrounds eat different foods. The areas in which families live and where their ancestors
originated influence food like and dislikes. These food preferences result in patterns of food choices within a cultural or regional group.<br>
<br>

    We should embrace our heritage through our culture’s food but we should also become more informed about other cultures by trying their
foods. It’s important to remember that each dish has a special place in the culture to which it belongs, and is special to those who prepare it. Food is
a portal into culture, and it should be treated as such.

          Hello, my name is Maria Savani. My major is policy studies and my minor is information management and technology. I enjoy studying how policy influences society, government, business, and environment. I have been given the honor of exploring many different kinds of policy in my day to day life which introduced me to many educational opportunities. Outside of school I enjoy <strong>cooking</strong>, exploring the world, and spending time with my family in Cleveland, Ohio. Ever since I was a kid I have had a passion for food and cooking. Nothing excites me more than the idea of traveling around the world and endulging myelf in coutries culinary traditions. I have created this cite to inspire people like me to travel around the word and taste foods that define each coutry.
