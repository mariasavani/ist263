            Hungary: Goulash - Goulash literally translates to "Herdsman" in Hungarian because they
            made the dish during cattle drives in harsh conditions. Although, the meaty stew didn't get
            its rich red color until Turks invaded and introduced paprika to the country during the 16th
            century. If you visit in September, check out the annual goulash festival held in Szolnok.
