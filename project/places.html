<h2>Austria's Apfelstrudel</h2>
<p>
    Try Apfelstrudel! Apfelstrudel or Viennese apple strudel is a close cousin to classic American apple pie. Tart apple is paired with sweet pastry dough for a delicious combination. This sweet treat consists of thin layers of dough filled with a flavorful apple filling. The oldest known recipe for strudel dates back to 1696, while other varieties, such as the apple strudel recipe, dating back to the 1800s. Some claim the dish was invented in Vienna for the Emperor of Austria and the rest of high society. Depending on the recipe, the filling may additionally include raisins, cinnamon, rum, and nuts such as almonds or walnuts. Austrians love eating it with their afternoon coffee.</p>

<div id="belgiuminfo">
<h2>Belgium's Moules Frites</h2>
<p>
    Moules-Frites or 'Moules et Frites' is the national dish of Belgium. Mussels and fries are as common in Belgium as burgers and fries are in the U.S.! The dish originated in Belgium. It is said that the combo was originally created by combining mussels, a popular and cheap eaten around the Flemish coast, and fried potatoes, which were commonly eaten around the country in winter when no fish or other food was available. In Belgium restaurants, you can find a great variety of steamed mussels: with cream, beer, tomato, or exotic spices. However, the most traditional is also the simplest: those cooked with shallots, white wine, and herbs.</p>

<h2>Canada's Poutine</h2>
<p>

    What's not to love about poutine? It is Gravy, fries, and cheese curds — a truly savory concoction! If that doesn't sound special to you, don't worry, restaurants have more than 100 variations to choose from, so there is something for everyone. Poutine emerged in Quebec, Canada, in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Québec region. However, its origins are uncertain, and there are several competing claims of having invented the now trendy dish. If you love this dish as much as we do, be sure to go to the Annual poutine celebrations in Montreal, Quebec City, and Drummondville!

    <h2> England's Steak and kidney pie </h2>
    <p>
        Don't worry- kidneys taste better than they sound! Steak and kidney pie is a fan favorite in England. The dish is most commonly made from lamb or pork kidneys. Britons love the melt-in-your-mouth texture and savory flavor. A true delicacy, especially if you're willing to pay for a homemade slice! A fun fact, the first recipe for steak and kidney pudding that appeared in print came from Sussex, in a book by Mrs. Beeton published by Ward, Lock, and Tyler in 1861. There is no evidence that the dish was made prior to the published recipes of the 19th century.

    <h2>Finland's Leipäjuusto</h2>
    <p>
        Finland is known for its Leipäjuusto-- better known as "Squeaky Cheese!" It is unlikely you'll find Leipäjuusto or squeaky Finnish cheese anywhere outside Finland. The mild cheese is most commonly pan-fried and served with cloudberry jam for dessert or alongside coffee. This cheese originated in Ostrobothnia in Northern Finland at least 200 years ago! It is a fresh cheese traditionally made from rich cow's milk, but nowadays, it is more common to use reindeer or even goat milk.

    <h2> Australia's Meat Pie </h2>
    <p>
        Get yourself some Meat Pie! - Australians sure do love their meat pies — they consume millions of pies annually, taking it on the go or enjoying it at a cafe. This iconic snack is hand-sized, containing diced or minced meat and gravy, sometimes with onion, mushrooms, or cheese. Eat it as locals do by topping it with warm or chilled tomato sauce. Australians' relationship with the pie goes back a long way. Back to Mother England, where the word 'pye' first entered the language in the 14th century. However, the early English pies weren't famed for their succulent flaky crust. Like the Romans and the Greeks before them, medieval pie-makers saw the pastry as a kind of makeshift casserole dish, which was generally thrown away after the contents were devoured.

    <h2>Hungary's Goulash</h2>
    <p>
        Hungary is known for its Goulash! It is is a soup or stew of meat and vegetables seasoned with paprika and other spices. Goulash's origins have been traced back to the 9th century, to stews eaten by Magyar shepherds. Goulash translates to "Herdsman" in Hungarian because they made the dish during cattle drives in harsh conditions. Before setting out with their flocks, they prepared a portable food stock by slowly cooking cut-up meats with onions and other seasonings until the liquids had been absorbed. The stew was then dried in the sun and packed into bags made of sheep's stomachs. Water was added to a portion of the meat at mealtime to reconstitute it into a soup or stew. Another interesting fact about Goulash is that it never had a rich red color until Turks invaded and introduced paprika to the country during the 16th century. If you visit in September, check out the annual goulash festival held in Szolnok!

    <h2> Italy's Deep-Fried Olives</h2>
    <p>
        A Unique treat you should make sure you get in your tummy when in Italy, deep-fried olives! The dish originated in the southern region in Ascoli- Piceno and has since spread north. You can choose a variety, from street vendors or local restaurants, from prosciutto-stuffed to ground- beef-stuffed. The deep-fried olive is usually stuffed with a meat filling -- hail from the province of Ascoli Piceno in Italy's central Le Marche region. They're so popular that they have found their way into bars across all of Italy. Commonly, they are part of an antipasto course or are one of the hearty nibbles during aperitivo to accompany a negroni or spritz. Either way, they're the sort of thing that would never be missed at a special occasion or a Sunday lunch with the whole family.

    <h2>Japan's Ramen </h2>
    <p>
      Ramen noodles don't come out of a styrofoam cup in Japan. Japanese ramen consists of Chinese-style noodles served in a meat broth flavored with soy sauce or miso. Each region of Japan has its own variation, and toppings range from boiled egg to corn. But ramen's popularity in Japan skyrocketed after the Second Sino-Japanese War when Japanese troops returned home from China with a new appreciation for Chinese cuisine. At that time, it is said that the Japanese called it "Dragon Noodle", which means that the dragon (Chinese) eats noodles. The term ramen was first introduced in the Taisho era. In 1918, it was said that the earliest appearance was Yokohama. The first thing that is popular with ramen is in Tokyo. The earliest ramen house was the Lai Lai in the Asakusa in Tokyo in the Meiji 43 years. This store has started the traditional Japanese-style soup with bonito and kelp broth mixed with pork bone or chicken bone soup to become a Tokyo-style soy sauce ramen.

    <h2> Poland's Chlodnik</h2>
    <p>
Chlodnik is a summer staple! Polish Chlodnik is a refreshing cold beet soup with vibrant pink color. The word Chlodnik means "vegetable soup," so you can create it with various veggies, although the most common is the beetroot version. It's flavored with cucumbers, radishes, plain yogurt, and topped with hard-boiled eggs, making it a truly healthy and delicious meal.  The result is a refreshing, vibrant pink soup. Always served well-chilled, chłodnik is typically garnished with boiled eggs, dill, and chives. It can occasionally incorporate cold cuts or roasted meats. This is a fun dish to try and make yourself! Many say you can't mess it up.

<div id= "africainfo"> 
    <h2>South Africa's Biltong</h2>
    <p>
        Biltong is made from spiced, dried, and cured meat, including beef and ostrich. It's usually eaten as a snack and tastes like a saltier version of beef jerky. Many locals dice the meat strips and add them to stews or muffins. You can also find biltong-flavored cheese spreads and potato chips in the country. Biltong is a traditional South African beef snack that is cured uniquely. The word comes from the Dutch bil, meaning hindquarter, and tong, meaning strip, in this case - a strip of meat. Although it looks similar to American beef jerky, it is quite different in flavor and method of preparation. The beef is dried with vinegar which cures the meat and adds layers of texture and flavor. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, and coriander, and the meat is much thicker than beef jerky. Initially, it was created out of necessity as a survival food when the Dutch settlers arrived in South Africa, but now it is a tasty snack!
