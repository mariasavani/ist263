    <h2> Australia's Meat Pie </h2>
    <p>
     Get yourself some Meat Pie! - Australians sure do love their meat pies — they consume millions of pies annually, taking it on the go or enjoying it at a cafe. Eat it like locals do by topping it with warm or chilled tomato sauce.
     Australians' relationship with the pie goes back a long way. Back to Mother England, where the word 'pye' first entered the language in the 14th century. However, the early English pies weren't famed for their succulent flaky crust. Like the Romans and the Greeks before them, medieval pie-makers saw the pastry as a kind of makeshift casserole dish, which was generally thrown away after the contents were devoured.

<div id= "hungaryinfo"> 
    <h2>Hungary's Goulash</h2>
    <p>
        Hungary is known for its Goulash! Goulash's origins have been traced back to the 9th century, to stews eaten by Magyar shepherds. Goulash translates to "Herdsman" in Hungarian because they made the dish during cattle drives in harsh conditions. Before setting out with their flocks, they prepared a portable food stock by slowly cooking cut-up meats with onions and other seasonings until the liquids had been absorbed. The stew was then dried in the sun and packed into bags made of sheep's stomachs. Water was added to a portion of the meat at mealtime to reconstitute it into a soup or stew. Another interesting fact about Goulash is that it never had a rich red color until Turks invaded and introduced paprika to the country during the 16th century. If you visit in September, check out the annual goulash festival held in Szolnok!

    <h2>Japan's Ramen </h2>
    <p>
      Ramen noodles don't come out of a styrofoam cup in Japan. Japanese ramen consists of Chinese-style noodles served in a meat broth flavored with soy sauce or miso. Each region of Japan has its own variation, and toppings range from boiled egg to corn. But ramen's popularity in Japan skyrocketed after the Second Sino-Japanese War when Japanese troops returned home from China with a new appreciation for Chinese cuisine. At that time, it is said that the Japanese called it "Dragon Noodle", which means that the dragon (Chinese) eats noodles. The term ramen was first introduced in the Taisho era. In 1918, it was said that the earliest appearance was Yokohama. The first thing that is popular with ramen is in Tokyo. The earliest ramen house was the Lai Lai in the Asakusa in Tokyo in the Meiji 43 years. This store has started the traditional Japanese-style soup with bonito and kelp broth mixed with pork bone or chicken bone soup to become a Tokyo-style soy sauce ramen.

    <h2>South Africa's Biltong</h2>
    <p>
    Biltong is made from a variety of spiced, dried and cured meat, including beef and ostrich. It's usually eaten as a snack and tastes like a saltier version of beef jerky. Many locals dice the meat strips and add them to stews or muffins. You can also find biltong-flavored cheese spreads and potato chips in the country. <br>Biltong is a traditional South African beef snack that is cured uniquely. The word comes from the Dutch bil, meaning hindquarter, and tong, meaning strip, in this case - a strip of meat. Although it looks similar to American beef jerky, it is quite different in flavor and method of preparation.<br>The beef is dried with vinegar which cures the meat and adds layers of texture and flavor. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, and coriander, and the meat is much thicker than beef jerky. Initially, it was created out of necessity as a survival food when the Dutch settlers arrived in South Africa.
